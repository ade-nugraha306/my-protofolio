# Traventura 🌍✨  
**Explore Indonesia smarter with AI.**  

Traventura is a capstone project developed for the **Dicoding Backend Developer Program**. It is a travel platform designed to help both local and international tourists discover destinations across Indonesia in a more personalized way — powered by machine learning.

## 🔍 What is Traventura?  
Traventura combines RESTful API architecture with a recommendation system using **machine learning classification** to suggest suitable travel destinations based on user preferences. The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, with authentication handled via **JWT** (manual and Google OAuth).

## 🧠 Core Features
- ✅ User authentication (email/password & Google)
- 📍 Booking system with user-linked data
- 💬 Comment and review system with validation
- 🤖 Travel recommendation using trained ML model
- 📦 Clean, modular RESTful API for scalable development

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **ML Model**: Python (tensorflow keras)
- **Authentication**: JWT + Google OAuth
- **Documentation**: Apidog

## 🎯 Purpose
This project aims to demonstrate backend proficiency, API design, and machine learning integration. Traventura also serves as a practical solution for those who want to explore Indonesia efficiently based on real-time preferences and context-aware suggestions.
