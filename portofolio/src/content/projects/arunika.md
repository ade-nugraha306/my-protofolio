# Arunika
**Manage your event**

Arunika is a digital solution for event attendance management for Informatics Engineering students and friends. With a QR Code-based attendance system, every attendance becomes more practical, efficient, and real-time.

## What is Arunika?
Arunika is an event attendance website developed by the RUJAK (Ruang Ujian dan Kajian/Exam and Study Room) team. The name “Arunika” itself means the first light of the sun in the morning-a symbol of a new beginning. In accordance with its meaning, Arunika is present as a starting point for digitizing student academic and non-academic activities.

## Features
- ✅ **QR Code-based Attendance**  
  Students can simply scan the QR Code at the event venue to fill in attendance.
- 📅 **Event Management Dashboard**  
  Admin can organize events, and anyone can see who attended, and download attendance data.
- 📊 **Realtime Absence Tracking**  
  Track live and automatic attendance statistics.

## Tech Stack
- **PHP Native**
- **MySQL**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Purpose
Arunika was developed as a student initiative to simplify attendance documentation at every campus event. With this digital approach, we hope that the administrative process can be more time-efficient, reduce the use of paper, and provide a modern and user-friendly experience.
